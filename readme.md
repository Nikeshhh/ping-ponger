# PingPong with multiplayer

This is my implementation of game called PingPong with multiplayer possibility. Made only for since)

Current state of project:
* Client module draws everything fine
* I decided to remake architecture, so server could run multiple games
* Server properly handles movement of one connected player
* Made bouncer which successfully synchronizes ball movement

Planned functionality:
- [x] Client module
- [x] Separate server module
- [ ] Totally playable 1v1
- [ ] Client-server data transition with sockets
- [ ] Player profiles
- [ ] Games history
- [ ] Best players statistic
- [ ] Server can serve multiple games ?
